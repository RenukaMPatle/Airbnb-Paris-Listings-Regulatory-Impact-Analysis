# Airbnb-Paris-Listings-Regulatory-Impact-Analysis
Analyzed Airbnb listing data for Paris to understand price trends, supply growth, and the effects of government regulations on host behavior and market dynamics.
 
**Objective:**
To evaluate how Airbnb listings and prices evolved in Paris over time and analyze the market’s response to the 2015 rental regulation. The goal was to draw insights into host behavior, pricing shifts, and platform strategy under regulatory pressures.

**Description:**
This project focuses on a detailed analysis of Airbnb listings in Paris, examining trends in supply (number of listings), pricing, and regulatory influence from the platform’s launch through 2019. Using data including host information, listing prices, availability, and timeline of listings, the project tracks:

- Growth patterns of Airbnb in Paris from inception to 2019
- Pricing behavior during different phases: early adoption, market maturity, and regulation
- Market response to the 2015 rental regulation announcement 
- Strategic insights into how regulatory changes affect supply, pricing, and user confidence

**Final Insight :** 
1.The Number of AirBnBs kept on increasing since the launch and prices kept on increasing too, due to initial traction and early adopters.
2.After the startup is known to everyone and becomes a common utility, AirBnBs start increasing in numbers and prices also kept on decreasing.
3.After regulation was announced around 2015 there was under confidence in the business, number of AirBnBs started decreasing and prices started increasing.
4.Once the regulation is the new normal, during the year 2019 the number of AirBnBs have increased in number and prices kept decreasing due to more supply of them.

**Recommendation for AirBnB:**
1.Regulations in long term rentals can impact the business adversely, there might be customer and hosts churn due to uncertainty.Such regulations might add to AirBnBs losses which might be difficult to recover later.
2.If the customer experience is going to get impacted due to this, it would lead to incorrect brand perception.
3.It is recommended to watch out for any such regulations at other places and be prepared for it.
4.AirBnB can replicate such regulations at other places.
5.They can keep strict rules to onboard and release the hosts.
6.They can limit the number of AirBnBs in a locality to ensure the public has enough rental options and the government doesn't step in.
